<h3>To the Shareholders of Alotonic Beverages Inc.</h3>
<p>Per-share market value of our common stock outstanding increased 157.89% this
year, from a level of $3.80 to $6.00. Our dividend yields increased by 490%;
from $0.0517 per $3.80 share in 2011 to $0.40 per $6.00 share. </p>
<p>The board of directors and I are happy with the performance of Alotonic
Beverages for 2012. As a relatively new, high-growth company, Alotonic is
experiencing a number of unusual circumstances, which are not likely to endure
in future years as the company becomes more established in the marketplace. Here
are a few of these circumstances and other changes that our company has
experienced in 2012:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>This year, our executives undertook a variety of projects that promise
    to benefit the company in the long run. Our extremely capable Chief
    Information Officer, Joseph Harkins, created a website for our company,
    which brings the information usually available only in the hard copy of our
    annual reports to the larger audience on the Internet.</p>
    <p>This is a big step for our company: since we became incorporated in 2010,
    our operations have taken place only on a local basis. This website is the
    first step for our company to begin entering the national beverage and food
    services market, with the ability to advertise and appeal to a much larger
    audience. On a more individual level, this website also presents the
    information in this report in a more accessible format, which I recommend
    for any reader looking to find specific information quickly.</p>
    <p>Other noteworthy executive activities include the increased cash from
    operations and help in compiling this report I received from Chief Operating
    Officer Tomas Oyarzun, and the compilations of forecasts and EPS Analyses
    from Chief Financial Officer Nicole Gathers. All of them are indispensable
    top-performers at Alatonic.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>On July 1, 2012, we issued debt for the first time. We were able to
    offer 1000 bonds (face value of $1000) at a premium of 104.5, increasing our
    cash balance, giving us opportunities to invest in 2013, and giving us a
    chance to establish an even stronger credit rating once the bonds are paid
    on July 1, 2016. </p>
    <p>Our cash balance was further increased by record sales revenue and gross
    profit, which indicates that demand for our product is increasing steadily.
    Our forecasted income for 2013 continues this trend; it appears that
    Alotonic’s products are beginning to gain consumer awareness and momentum on
    a local scale, which will only increase as we begin to operate on a national
    scale. </p>

    <p>A final major boost to our cash balance worth mentioning was the
    successful sale of a number of capital assets, including equipment and land.
    The sale of these capital assets has been in the works for quite some time,
    and this year we were able to reach a few numbers (maximizing gains and
    minimizing losses) that we were happy with. These investment decisions
    bolstered our net income for the year, compensating for the introduction of
    a number of new operating expenses, and giving us a strong bottom line. </p>

    </li>
    <li><p>These major cash increases, along with a number of more minor
    transactions that increased cash for 2012, have led to us having a record
    amount of cash on hand—by far. This has led to enormous changes in our
    liquidity, including increases in net working capital, our quick ratio, and
    our cash ratio. This increase in liquidity is a golden opportunity for us;
    we have so much more cash than current liabilities that we can invest in a
    variety of future projects without fearing our creditors.</p>
    <p>This increase in liquidity is not an unmixed blessing, however. Higher
    net working capital indicates a lower than optimal level of efficiency,
    which we will work to amend in 2013. We will go into a more in-depth
    examination of this efficiency later. For now suffice it to say that, for a
    company in our current high-growth opportunity situation, it is better to
    have cash on hand than to have a wide dispersion of less liquid current
    assets. Nevertheless, we can always become more efficient, and plan to take
    measures to do so in the coming years.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now, for the bad news. Because we issued debt and took a number
    of loans for this year, our debt ratios have increased, and the company is
    more financed by debt than equity this year. While this is necessary for our
    company presently, we will strive to increase equity proportionally if we
    need to assume more debt in the future.</p>
    <p> An additional drawback to our year’s performance was the extent to which the
    sale of our capital assets bolstered our bottom line net income. Investors
    can expect net income for 2013 to be lower than it was in 2012, because we
    have no further plans to sell capital assets during the course of the next
    year unless, of course, the price is right. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Alotonic Beverages Inc. is on the precipice of a brave new
    world. We are beginning the transition from a small, local business to an
    international corporation, and there are bound to be a number of adjustments
    which we might call “growing pains” in the next few years. Our business
    model is sound, however, and we have reason to be optimistic about
    Alotonic’s continued high performance in the larger marketplace.</p>
    <p>There are four broad measures to consider performing our business
    analysis. These include liquidity, solvency, profitability, and market
    indicator issues. Through examining these measures more closely, we hope to
    show you that our vision for providing healthy, organic energy drinks for
    the active, free spirited individual has never been clearer.</p>

<h3>Business Analysis</h3>
<h4>Liquidity</h4>
<p>The first measure to consider for our company’s 2012 results is liquidity. Liquidity is a measure of whether the company is able to pay its short term bills as they come due. The massive increase in cash and other current assets for 2012 from a variety of streams, including sales revenue, the sale of land and equipment, and the issuance of new bonds, have led to significant changes in our company’s current assets. Significant changes in payables, especially dividends payable, in 2012, have similarly affected the company’s current liabilities balance. All of this has led to a change in the company’s ability to cover its current obligations (liabilities) with the resources (current assets) it has on hand. The company’s altered liquidity is therefore an important measure for us to consider when evaluating Alotonic as a whole.</p>
<p>For 2012, our current ratio was 2.2768, indicating that current assets outnumbered current liabilities by a factor of more than two to one on December 31. The high number of current assets can mostly be attributed to the significant increase in cash we experienced during the year, which was offset by the declaration of dividends payable in the current liabilities section. While this year we have a slightly lower current ratio than last year’s, we also experienced a huge increase of cash, and with it, a heightened ability to quickly pay our debts. We have a high number of current assets to current liabilities, and viewed historically, the 2012 current ratio indicates that our company’s health is still good. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/cr.png" /></p>
<p>It is important to note that, while the ratio of current assets to current liabilities for December 31, 2012 is smaller than the ratio between the two numbers for December 31, 2011 (3.000), the massive increases experienced in both current assets and current liabilities makes comparison between the two years difficult. 2012 was a high growth year for us, and we experienced several changes in our current assets and current liabilities that led to an increase in both.  This increase is expressed using horizontal analysis between the balances of assets and liabilities for the past two years of operation, using 2010 as a base year.</p>
<p>While the current ratio is informative in providing an overall view of current assets to current liabilities, some current assets (such as inventory) may not be liquid enough to convert to cash quickly to cover debts. To get a clearer picture of our ability to pay our debts quickly, there are two useful ratios to consider. The first ratio, the quick (acid-test) ratio, compares the number of more liquid current assets (cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities) to the company’s total number of current liabilities. On December 31, 2012, Alotonic’s Quick Ratio was 2.0849, much higher than the previous year’s December 31 ratio of 1.7417. This demonstrates that our ability to pay debts quickly has improved, as we have more than two dollars of liquid current assets per each dollar of current liabilities. For the past three years, we have grown our quick ratio as a steady rate, and intend to do so in future years as we assume more debt to expand.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/qr.png" /></p>
<p>The aptly named cash ratio, is used to compare a company’s cash balance to its current liabilities. The cash ratio for Alotonic has historically been quite low, and we have worked hard to create more of a cash buffer to increase our ability to pay debts instantly and make purchases on short notice. On December 31, 2012, despite a large increase in current liabilities, we were able to increase our cash ratio to 1.677, meaning that we have approximately $1.68 in cash for every $1.00 in current liabilities. For us at Alotonic, cash is an extremely important tool. As the most liquid asset in any company’s portfolio (indeed, it is sometimes referred to as “liquidity” itself), cash is the surest means with which to make purchases and pay debts extremely quickly. Alotonic is no exception to this rule: we have been increasing our cash balance to keep pace with our increase in current liabilities, enabling us to completely cover short-term obligations in 2013 with cash, if the need arises.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/Liabilities_CashRatio.png" /></p>
<p>When further considering our cash situation, it is important to look at Alotonic’s ratio of cash from operations to current liabilities. While our cash balance has increased dramatically, it is important to evaluate how much of this increase can be attributed to the company’s actual operations, as opposed to sales of land, equipment, and the issuance of debt. The ratio as of December 31, 2012 was .3829, so the cash from operations covers 38.29% of the total current liabilities balance. Cash from operations alone could cover more than $0.38 for every $1.00 of current liabilities, so our operations are considered an essential part of our business strategy. Vertical analysis of the statement of cash flows determines that, this year, cash from operations comprised 43.10% of the total cash increase for Alotonic.</p>
<p>Further analysis shows that, like the total cash ratio, the cash from operations ratio has increased alongside the current liabilities. Since this is only the third year of Alotonic’s operations, only two years of this ratio are available. However, it is promising that cash from operations is increasing, not decreasing, as the total current liabilities number rises. It is difficult to piece together a trend from only two years of information, but improving cash from operations to match increases in total current liabilities is a good goal for Alotonic in future years. Keeping this number high, in other words, will give us security by enabling us to cover our current liabilities with cash from operations.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/Cash_from_Operations.png" /></p>
<p>Another useful ratio for determining Alotonic’s liquidity position is the net working capital to total assets ratio. Net working capital as of December 31, 2012 at Alotonic was 3,654,000, so we are more than able to pay off our current debts. Using the ratio, we can determine that for year-end 2012 the net working capital was 36.55% of total assets, indicating that Alotonic has a significant financial cushion, and a large amount of flexibility in terms of future acquisition of assets and assumption of debt. At the very least, our high net working capital indicates that we will not have trouble paying short-term creditors back. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/nwcttar.png" /></p>
<p>While the benefits of this high net working capital and its ratio to total assets are apparent, in that we are able to pay off its current obligations without much trouble, it should also be pointed out that net working capital could, in our case, be at too high a level at present. Too high a net working capital ratio can indicate potential inefficiency. Two turnover ratios can be used to further explore the possibility of this inefficiency.</p>
<p>The inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover ratios are important tools for identifying aspects of a firm’s efficiency through finding the amount of time a company takes on average to complete various tasks. The inventory turnover ratio for Alotonic for the year 2012 was 1.4334, meaning that Alotonic’s inventory was sold and replaced just under one and a half times during the year. By dividing the number of days in the period, 365, by the inventory turnover ratio, it is possible to ascertain how many days it took for Alotonic to sell the inventory it had on hand. In 2012, it took 255 days, which was much faster than the 2011 rate of 376 days. This indicates increased efficiency, at least when it comes to managing inventory.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to forecast next year’s inventory specifics, we are optimistic that we will be able to continue to increase inventory turnover, increasing our growing company’s efficiency. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/it.png" /></p>
<p>For 2012, the receivables turnover ratio was 3.5791, which is lower (and indicates lower efficiency) than the 2011 receivables turnover ratio of 4.9694. Higher receivables turnover ratios indicate higher sales relative to accounts receivable, and since accounts receivable rose dramatically during 2012, it is understandable that the receivables turnover ratio decreased. As a measure of efficiency, however, this number is an important red flag for us when viewed alongside the high net working capital. Alotonic is in a strong financial position, but we must focus on making collections in the near future if we intend to maintain financial security.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/art.png" /></p>
<p>Overall, Alotonic Beverages Inc. has a strong liquidity position. Because of the issuance of debt, the sale of capital assets, increased accounts receivable, and other cash-related transactions, current assets for 2012 increased dramatically. While this was accompanied by a roughly commensurate increase in current liabilities, Alotonic’s cash balance has never been higher, and we are prepared to pay all of our short term debts in 2013 with cash, if need be. The one area in which we can see real improvement is in efficiency. While our inventory turnover ratio has increased, indicating a shorter and faster inventory cycle, we believe that we can see even more improvements in future years. </p>
<p>Additionally, our current net working capital is extremely high. While having security in this form is convenient, especially since we are entering a period of rapid expansion, it is also leading to a degree of inflexibility that we will remedy. A symptom of this inflexibility can be seen in the declining accounts receivable ratio. It is important to collect and pay our accounts in a timely manner, or risk being caught flat-footed at the end of the year with taxes or owed debts. Our short term position, though it could always improve in certain areas, is quite good overall. It is time to turn our gaze to Alotonic’s long term performance. </p>
<h4>Solvency</h4>
<p>While liquidity is an important factor to consider when analyzing the short term situation for Alotonic, the solvency of the company is informative about its performance in the long term. Solvency provides measures of the company’s ability to survive over a long period of time. To an extent, solvency is an uncertain method for evaluating the future performance of a company, because it relies on technical analysis (quantitative examinations of past results) to make forecasts. In a rapidly and dramatically changing economic environment, it is impossible to certainly predict the results of the company. However, in our case it is worth taking the time to conduct tests for solvency because of the information it provides about Alotonic for the company’s present day position. </p>
<p>Alotonic’s debt-to-equity ratio for December 31, 2012 was 1.0989, significantly higher than the previous year’s balance of .4014. This is a result from two loans Alotonic took out, one a long term $100,000 note payable from a bank and the other a $600,000 short term note payable from a private lender. This higher debt-to-equity ratio indicates that the firm is relying more heavily on debt this year than last, which is an indication of higher volatility. Viewed alongside total shareholder equity, is clear that the decrease in equity is a significant factor in the increased debt-to-equity ratio. While this is seemingly obvious, it is worth pointing out because it shows that the increased level of debt is not solely responsible for the higher ratio.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/dter.png" /></p>
<p>This higher volatility (along with a higher degree of risk) is further explored in a series of other debt ratios. The first of these, the long term debt ratio, is a measure of the firm’s long term debt against its long term debt added to equity. The 2012 ratio was .3280, much higher than 2011’s level of .2002, indicating that debt is rising as a percentage of Alotonic’s total long term capital. This trend is reinforced by the firm’s long term debt-equity ratio, which is up to .4881 at year-end 2012 from .2503 in 2011. As an indicator of leverage, Alotonic’s increasing levels of long term debt should be paid close attention to, because too high a level of leverage will leave Alotonic unable to pay its bills in the long run. Because Alotonic has almost $0.50 in long term debt for every $1.00 in equity, it is especially important to ensure that shareholder returns are not adversely affected by raising the leverage.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/ltdr.png" /></p>
<p>Alatonic’s increasing levels of debt are even more apparent after taking the firm’s total debt ratio into consideration. At year-end 2011, the total debt ratio stood at .2864, meaning that debt financed only 28.64% of the company, while equity accounted for the remaining 71.36%. Today, at year-end 2012, the firm’s total debt ratio has risen to .5236, a massive increase from last year’s levels. Much of this can be attributed to the firm’s declaration of $1,200,000 in dividends for 2013, which raised the current liabilities considerably. At least as important, however, was Alotonic’s issuance of $1,000,000 in four-year, semi-annual bonds, which will remain as long-term liabilities on the balance sheet until the principal is paid on July 1, 2016. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/tdr.png" /></p>
<p>The increase in the total debt ratio is not an indication of financial distress for Alotonic: it can be viewed as the exact opposite. Shareholders have seen an almost tenfold increase in their dividends, and much of our debt also came from an issuance of bonds that provided us with a large amount of cash for investing and operations. Our strengthened cash position is noteworthy when considering the total debt ratio in order to keep the increase in perspective.</p>
<p>A final set of ratios to consider when evaluating Alotonic’s solvency are the cash coverage and times interest earned ratios, both of which examine Alotonic’s ability to pay interest obligations. The times interest earned ratio for Alotonic is 11.7052, which is a healthy increase from the previous year’s level of 8.1644. In other words, Alotonic is able to cover its interest obligations almost twelve times with its earnings before tax and interest (operating income). This number is raised when computing the cash coverage ratio, which adds depreciation back to operating income for a more realistic view of how able Alotonic is to cover interest obligations. Alotonic’s cash coverage ratio this year is 27.8124, which indicates a strong ability for Alotonic to cover its interest obligations based on operating income alone. The forecast for 2013 is available in this ratio, and is far larger than any previous year, due to a lowered interest expense and an increased operational income.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/tie.png" /></p>
<p>The solvency of Alotonic Beverages Inc. is quite strong. Although higher levels of debt are present in our company, the corresponding inflow of cash has strengthened the assets on our balance sheet, and maneuvered us into a position of high liquidity and low risk of short term default. It has also opened the door for future investing and operational activities that would be impossible with less capital. Issuing debt at a premium in 2012 was an extremely fortunate circumstance, as was our ability to declare larger dividends for our shareholders. This declaration of dividends represents only a temporary lowering of Alotonic’s equity, and we expect to be able to issue large dividends in the future without adversely affecting our debt ratios. We are very optimistic about Alatonic’s future performance, because most of our expenses are expected to decrease and revenues are expected to increase in 2013, which topics examined in the next section, profitability. </p>
<h4>Profitability</h4>
<p>Alotonic’s profitability ratios serve as indicators of whether the company can provide satisfactory returns, both in the short and the long term. Not only are the current year’s results found and analyzed; they are used to make inferences about future years’ potential profitability as well. To do this, the ratios used to find Alotonic’s profitability focus on the use of assets and capital to generate income, and this income is compared against the incomes of previous years to estimate the firm’s relative level of performance. It is important to note that higher profits do not necessarily indicate greater efficiency in the firm’s operations, because high profits can be associated with lower profit margins. Investors should pay special attention to the ratios in this section, because they may reveal information that a quick glance through Alotonic’s financials would not be able to provide.</p>
<p>To start with, a couple of important measures of efficiency are the ratios involving Alotonic’s return on assets and return on capital. There was a significant addition of assets during 2012, and the net income increased considerably as well. Alotonic’s return on assets is .0956, so net income accounted for 9.56% of the total assets number. In other words, every $1.00 of assets corresponded to around $0.09 of net income. This is an increase from the previous year’s level of .0650, which indicates that Alotonic’s management was more effective at utilizing assets to generate income for the year. Alotonic’s return on capital is also much higher for 2012, reaching a level of .1341 from .0729 the previous year. Our management was also apparently better able to use capital to generate the firm’s returns in 2012, indicating a higher level of efficiency in Alotonic’s operations.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/roc.png" /></p>
<p>Alotonic’s return on equity is another important return ratio, which rose to .2007 in 2012 from a 2011 level of .0911. This ratio is especially important to investors because it shows how well our company spent your money, and we are pleased to announce that shareholder investments have been more than twice as effective this year as they were last year. This is due to a variety of activities that have yielded high returns for 2012. It is worth noting here, however, that operational efficiency is not the only factor which contributed to our company’s high ratios of return. Much of the company’s net income was derived from successful investing activities, including the successful sale of a large parcel of land. To get a better idea of how effective shareholder equity and assets were on generating income for the year, it is worth looking at them side by side.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/ROA_ROE.png" /></p>
<p>Over time, we are learning to use both assets and equity more effectively in order to generate returns. This year, our declared dividends lowered equity considerably, and net income skyrocketed, which accounts for the more than twofold increase in our return on equity ratio. The return on assets number is a more accurate reflection of our increased efficiency, and it should be kept in mind that net income had a significant effect here as well. Additionally, since much of net income came from a gain on the sale of a capital asset (land), it is unlikely to be as high next year, so the return ratios may experience a readjustment. This is not cause for alarm, however, because our core operations are expected to perform at their best level so far in the company’s history, and long term return ratios can be expected to exceed 2012 levels. </p>
<p>Another indicator of Alotonic’s increased managerial efficiency is the asset turnover ratio, which rose to .4154 from .3563 the previous year. Each $1.00 of Alotonic’s assets was able to generate more than $0.41 in sales revenue in 2012. Unlike the other return ratios concerning profitability, the asset turnover ratio deals only with the operational side of the business, and doesn’t take into account potential investing gains. Its increase is a more concrete indication of Alotonic’s increased efficiency. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/Sales_AssetTurnoverforecast.png" /></p>
<p>While the 2012 asset turnover number is the highest it has been for our company so far, we believe that we can use our assets even more efficiently to generate higher sales and profits for our investors. Our forecast for the 2013 asset turnover ratio indicates a slight downturn, but this should be attributed to the fact that the year-end total assets for 2012 so far exceeded other year end asset balances that a period of readjustment is necessary. While reconciling sales revenue to the newly increased total assets balance may take time, this is healthy and necessary in order for Alotonic to grow, and several such periods may be expected over the long term, assuming that we prosper. Nevertheless, we will continue to strive to increase sales in order to keep up with increases in total assets.</p>
<p>While striving to increase sales, we must also remember to manage the increase of expenses to a healthy level. Pursuing a higher turnover ratio should also lead to higher return ratios, or the benefits to investors are negligible. For instance, were Alotonic able to make double its current sales but quadrupled its current expenses, the return ratios would not be affected, and the company’s investors would be no better off.</p>
<h4>Profits</h4>
<p>It is most important when assessing a firm’s profitability to examine the actual profits. We had a very profitable year in 2012, with gross profit of $1,858,000, and a gross profit ratio of .6389. While this gross profit ratio is slightly lower than the previous year’s of .6509, the decrease can largely be attributed to an unusually high percentage of cost of goods sold to total sales, which is forecasted to decrease in 2013. This decrease, and gross profit’s correspondingly higher ratio, can be attributed to a decline in expenses and increase in sales revenue related to collections on deferred revenue accounts. Gross profit is more of an at-a-glance indicator of the company’s efficiency, however, and provides us with relatively little information. This is especially the case for Alotonic’s 2012 results, in which a large number of new operating expenses were introduced which did not alter gross profit, but greatly affected operating income.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/gpr.png" /></p>
<p>While the gross profit and its ratio to total sales are expected to increase in 2013, it is worth noting that this says little about our actual projected profitability. It is a positive indication that we are learning to manage the cost of goods expense more effectively, but says little about the bottom line results of our company, and should not affect investor sentiment one way or another about our performance. It is a useful measurement of efficiency with regard to an important expense, but is not necessarily indicative of a company’s distress or health.</p>
<p>Alotonic’s operating income for 2012 was $409,683. This is almost $50,000 less than the previous year’s operating profit, but it should be noted that this decrease in profit was facilitated, and perhaps completely caused, by several new expenses for the year which include advertising expense, utility expense, rent expense, and a number of more minor expenses. The operating profit margin was similarly decreased to .1409 from .1886, which appears to be an extremely significant decrease. After all, operating income falling from almost 19% to only 14% of total sales is almost never a good sign. It is important to keep in mind, however, that this was the first year in which Alotonic began paying these new expenses. A decrease in operating income was inevitable with these expenses, and is to be expected with any company undergoing a year of significant “growing pain” changes. Forecasted sales and expenses for 2013 are forecasted to settle down from this year’s tumultuousness, however, and both gross profit and operating income should rise to stronger levels. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/om.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that the operating income is a more accurate reflection of the company’s profitability, because it takes operating expenses into consideration along with the cost of goods sold. It is not, however, the bottom line either. Like gross profit, operating income provides more information about our efficiency than about our direct profitability. This information is useful, but it should not be taken as solely indicative of a company’s health. Rather, it should serve as a commentary on the efficacy of Alotonic’s operations. In the case of 2012, the decreased efficiency can be attributed to the aforementioned newly introduced operating expenses. Our 2013 forecast reflects a resolution to adjust to these new operating expenses and increase our efficiency with these new expenses in mind.</p>
<p>Another piece of good news is that the net income and the profit margin for 2012 are both significantly higher than they were in 2011. This was due to a strong core of operational activity coupled with a significant gain on the sale of a parcel of land, which raised net income to $955,908 (profit margin .3287) from the previous year’s $455,000 (profit margin .1869). This sale of land more than compensated for the newly incurred operational expenses in 2012, and helped to make the sizable increase in dividends payable for 2013 possible. </p>
<p>It should be noted that Alotonic has no plans currently to make a significant sale in 2013, so net income may fall from its extremely high 2012 level at the end of 2013. The profit margin may also be expected to fall significantly. This should not be a cause for concern, however, because the net income number will likely not contain gains from the sale of capital assets in 2013. Of the three profit ratios so far discussed, the profit margin ratio is the most informative with regard to Alotonic’s performance, because it compares bottom line profits to total sales revenue. In 2012, both net profit and net sales increased dramatically, leading to a higher profit and higher profit margin to total sales than in the previous two years. This margin is forecasted to decrease in 2013, after we adjust to the large increases in total assets and the gain on sale of land which we experienced in 2012.</p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/pmr.png" /></p>
<p>A final ratio for consideration, of special interest to both current and prospective investors, is Alotonic’s earnings per share (EPS) for 2012. EPS more than doubled from 2011 to 2012, which again can be attributed to the investment gains Alotonic experienced. Alotonic’s EPS exceeded analyst’s expectations, and a more thorough examination of what exactly contributed to this success, along with graphical analysis, appears later in this prospectus.</p>
<p>Profitability was unusual in 2012 for a variety of reasons. Large numbers of operating expenses were introduced which lowered the operating income, yet net income was far higher in 2012 than in either 2010 or 2011. Perhaps most noteworthy for the bottom line was the sale of a parcel of land, on which we experienced a gain of $600,000. This gain affected net income directly, without passing through gross profit and operating income, and is the reason that net income appears gigantic when compared to the other ratios examining trends over the past three years. This gain on the sale of land completely countered the effect of the increased operating expenses which led to a lower operating income in 2012, and is part of the reason that we are able to declare dividends for our shareholders payable in 2013. </p>
<h4>Market Indicators</h4>
<p>The final ratios for evaluating Alotonic as a business are the market indicators. Market indicator ratios provide information as to whether a company’s stock is a good investment, and contain valuable information for prospective buyers and sellers alike. These ratios deal with market vs. book values, dividend yields, and potential growth opportunities for Alotonic in the long term. Note that this information is intended for, and useful to, investors as opposed to speculators. It goes without saying that long term holders of Alotonic’s stock will benefit far more from the information contained in this section than short term traders will.</p>
<p>EPS is a profitability ratio, giving information as to how well the company performed given the amount of outstanding stock it has issued. It is also a valuable tool when calculating the company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares each share’s market value to the earnings that each share was able to generate. For Alotonic, the market value of each share was $6.00. The P/E ratio for 2012 was 18.8303. Historical data is an important tool when calculating a company’s P/E ratio, especially since this information is intended to be useful for investors. In 2011 and 2010, though the market value per share was more than two dollars less than the 2012 value, the P/E ratios were 25.0549 and 22.3220, respectively. </p>

<p>Higher P/E ratios generally indicate a higher level of optimism regarding a company’s future growth among investors, but Alotonic is an interesting case. Our decreased P/E ratio was not the result of investors’ pessimism, but was rather due to an earnings increase that exceeded even the doubled share price. Because earnings are expected to settle down in 2013, it is projected that the P/E ratio will rise considerably, and more accurately reflect the optimistic investor sentiment regarding Alotonic.  </p>
<p>While Alotonic’s current market value is $6.00 per share, it is crucial to understand that this number alone says very little about each share’s intrinsic value. To do this, the book value per share must be calculated and compared to the market value using the book-to-market ratio. The book value per share of Alotonic stock for 2012 is approximately $1.59, lower than the previous year’s value of approximately $1.67. The book-to-market ratio for Alotonic is much lower, however, because the market value jumped to $6.00 per share from $3.80 per share. For 2012, the book-to-market ratio was .2646, while it was .4382 in 2011. This indicates a high degree of optimism among investors purchasing shares of Alotonic.</p>

<p>Despite a decline in the firm’s book value for share for 2012, market value in fact rose. This seeming paradox can partially be explained by investor sentiment, which favors Alotonic’s long term growth despite a temporary decline in book value. We believe that this sentiment is correct. 2012 was a high growth, unusual year, which we believe heralds the onset of more high growth periods in the near future. This, coupled with the recently declared dividends, provide powerful incentives for long term investors.</p>
<p>A couple of useful ratios in evaluating Alotonic’s capital dispersion strategy are the payout and plowback ratios. The payout ratio, indicative of how much of the company’s earnings were distributed to shareholders, was .1621 in 2012 and .2967 in 2011. Again, the decrease in the payout ratio can be attributed to the higher net income in 2012, rather than a lower payment of dividends. Indeed, more dividends were paid in 2012 than in either of Alotonic’s previous years of operation. Dividends per share in 2012 were $0.05, compared to $0.045 the year before. The massive increase in dividends payable in 2013, assuming 3,000,000 shares are still outstanding, should raise the dividends per share to $0.40, raising the projected payout ratio to 1.9061, and necessitating a dip into preexisting funds to pay for the dividends that have already been declared. Fortunately, we have built up a huge cash balance to provide for this fund, so net income will not be the source of the 2013 dividends.</p>

<p>The plowback ratio for Alotonic is simply the amount reinvested in the company’s operations, rather than being paid out in dividends. For Alotonic, the plowback ratio in 2012 was .8379, indicating that the large majority of the company’s income was reinvested for operations in 2013. Investing in the company for much larger future returns is a high priority for us, especially during years with high net incomes. That way, investors can enjoy increased dividends while resting assured that even higher dividends may be declared in the future.</p>
<p>The final ratio for considering Alotonic’s business position is its sustainable growth rate (SGR). SGR measures how much Alotonic can grow without borrowing more money from short and long term lenders, and is a measure of how self-supporting the business has become. In 2012, the SGR was .1682, compared to the 2011 SGR of .0641. In other words, without assuming more debt, we can expect to grow at a rate of 16.82% in 2013, which is the sort of extremely rapid growth we expected from our net income and projected operational capacities. </p>
<p><img src="img/graphs/sgr.png" /></p>
<p>Market indicators uniformly appear favorable for Alotonic at this stage. Our shares’ market value is increasing quickly, and after paying the next round of dividends in 2013, we expect it to rise still higher. It is difficult without the requisite “crystal ball” to forecast the performance of Alotonic’s stock price over the course of the next few years, but if they are at all reflective of the increased efficiency of our operations, investors can expect a healthy return. </p>
<h3>A Final Word</h3>
<p>Barring extraordinary events, the future is bright for us at Alotonic. With a high degree of liquidity, solid solvency, significant profitability, and favorable market indicators, we are poised to make a large impact on the beverage industry in the course of the next few years. We intend to continue improving our operations for the immediate future, with the goal of establishing a strong foundation of business practices, managerial techniques, and superior products in order to develop customer loyalty. In the longer term, investors can expect us to enter the marketplace in a significant way, bringing our quality products to bear against the larger corporations to acquire portions of their market share.</p>
